## Learnt
 
 - navbar : <br />
 - Having easy-to-use navigation is important for any web site.With CSS you can transform boring HTML menus into good-looking navigation bars.
 - <strong> Navigation Bar = List of Links</strong>
   - A navigation bar needs standard HTML as a base.
   - In our examples we will build the navigation bar from a standard HTML list.
   - A navigation bar is basically a list of links, so using the ul and li elements makes perfect sense:
- Now let's remove the bullets and the margins and padding from the list:{   list-style-type: none;}
- list-style-type: none; - Removes the bullets. A navigation bar does not need list markers
    Set margin: 0; and padding: 0; to remove browser default settings.
- href link name same to acess the nav section id.
- The aspect-ratio CSS property sets a preferred aspect ratio for the box, which will be used in the calculation of auto sizes and some other layout functions
